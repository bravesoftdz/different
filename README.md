Hello to all!

I am amateur programmer who learns new tricks and approaches via existing algorithms and code. Now I have decided to create an account on *GitHub* in order to publish some adaptations of the third person's algorithms and code.  

At this moment there is only routines for performing fast and high quality blur on image. See folder 'Blur' for more info.  

New ported code will be added there after I will find useful code and algorithms.  

**Important!**  
*All rights to the original code and algorithms are belong to their authors!*  
I just make adaptations after getting e-mail permission for this from authors.  


Goodluck!
